The Multi-Vendor Ecommerce Platform (Major_project_2025) is a full-stack web application designed to create a dynamic, scalable, and user-friendly online marketplace. Built from scratch, this project enables multiple vendors to sell products, users to browse and purchase, and admins to manage the platform seamlessly. The application integrates modern web development technologies and advanced features to deliver a robust ecommerce experience, complete with secure payments, real-time communication, and responsive design.

This project was developed as part of a hands-on course led by Kazi Ariyan, focusing on building a real-world ecommerce platform using React, Node.js, Express, and MongoDB. It serves as a practical demonstration of full-stack development, showcasing the ability to design, implement, and deploy a complex application with industry-standard tools and practices.

Project Objectives
Build a multi-vendor ecommerce platform that supports distinct roles for users, vendors, and admins.
Implement a responsive, secure, and feature-rich application suitable for real-world deployment.
Apply modern web development techniques, including frontend-backend integration, real-time features, and secure authentication.
Demonstrate proficiency in end-to-end development, from database design to UI/UX.
Key Functionalities
The platform includes a comprehensive set of features to ensure a seamless ecommerce experience:

Order Tracking: View order history and status.
Live Chat: Communicate with vendors in real-time via Socket.io.
Vendor Features:
Product Management: Add, update, or remove products with stock tracking.
Order Fulfillment: Manage incoming orders and update statuses.
Payment Transfers: Receive payments from admins for completed orders.
Live Chat: Interact with users and admins in real-time.
Dashboard: Access a dedicated vendor dashboard for analytics and management.
Admin Features:
Platform Oversight: Manage users, vendors, and products.
Order & Payment Management: Oversee orders and facilitate payment transfers to vendors.
Product Banner Setup: Create promotional banners for products.
Live Chat: Communicate with vendors for support or coordination.
Admin Dashboard: Monitor platform performance and activity.
General Features:
User Authentication: Secure login/logout with JSON Web Tokens (JWT) and middleware for protected routes.
Responsive Design: Fully responsive UI built with Tailwind CSS, ensuring compatibility across devices.
Real-Time Notifications: Message notifications via Socket.io for chats and updates.
Image Uploads: Upload product images to Cloudinary for efficient storage.
Stock Management: Track product availability to prevent out-of-stock purchases.
Advanced Validation: Robust validation for login, checkout, and other forms.
API Integration: Seamless frontend-backend communication using Axios for GET/POST requests.
Technologies Used
The project leverages a modern tech stack to deliver a high-performance, scalable application:

Frontend:
React.js: For building a dynamic, component-based UI with Functional Components, Hooks, Redux, and React Router 6.
Tailwind CSS: For designing a fully responsive and visually appealing interface from scratch.
Axios: For handling API requests to the backend.
Backend:
Node.js & Express.js: For creating a robust, scalable RESTful API.
MongoDB: For efficient data storage and management of users, products, orders, and more.
Socket.io: For enabling real-time, bidirectional communication (e.g., live chat).
JSON Web Tokens (JWT): For secure user authentication and authorization.
Stripe: For processing payments securely in the checkout system.
Cloudinary: For managing product image uploads.
Other Tools & Libraries:
dotenv: For managing environment variables (e.g., Stripe API keys, MongoDB credentials).
Middleware: For protecting routes and ensuring secure access.
Git & GitHub: For version control and collaboration (repository: shagithubrit/Major_project_2025).
Security Considerations
Secret Management: Environment variables (via .env) are used to store sensitive data like Stripe API keys and MongoDB credentials, ensuring they are not hard-coded in the codebase.
Push Protection: GitHub’s Push Protection feature was utilized to prevent accidental exposure of secrets (e.g., Stripe Test API keys detected in orderController.js and paymentController.js).
Authentication: JWT-based authentication with middleware ensures secure access to protected routes.
Validation: Advanced validation for user inputs (e.g., email, password, checkout forms) enhances security.
Challenges Overcome
Secret Exposure: Addressed GitHub Push Protection errors by removing hard-coded Stripe Test API keys from backend/controllers/order/orderController.js and backend/controllers/payment/paymentController.js, replacing them with environment variables.
Authentication Issues: Resolved GitHub authentication failures by configuring a Personal Access Token (PAT) for HTTPS pushes, ensuring secure repository access.
History Rewriting: Used tools like git rebase and git-filter-repo to rewrite commit history and remove sensitive data, maintaining a clean repository.
